StateContext has a provider property which takes value from reducer
StateProvider is a function that takes all the input
then processes the StateContext

DataLayer --(calls)--> StateProvider --(manipulates)-->
StateContext <--(returns context)-- Reducer

so, StateContext is the main player here.

useState(StateContext) encompasses all of it.
